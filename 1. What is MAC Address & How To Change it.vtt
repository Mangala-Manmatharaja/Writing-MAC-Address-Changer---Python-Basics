00:02.350 --> 00:06.190
Now like I said The course is going to be highly practical.

00:06.190 --> 00:09.390
So I want to teach everything by example.

00:09.550 --> 00:15.300
Therefore we're literally going to start programming without even covering Python basics.

00:15.310 --> 00:19.900
We're going to cover the basics as we write our first program.

00:20.200 --> 00:27.220
Now the first program that I want to write is going to be a mock address changer MAC address stands

00:27.220 --> 00:29.480
for Media Access Control.

00:29.560 --> 00:37.300
It's a permanent physical and unique address assigned to network interfaces by the device manufacturer.

00:37.570 --> 00:44.280
So whether you have a wireless card or a wired or Internet Card each one of these network cards come

00:44.280 --> 00:47.920
up with a specific address that is unique to this card.

00:47.920 --> 00:54.850
So there is no two devices in the world that would have the same MAC address and this address will always

00:54.850 --> 00:57.660
be the same to this specific device.

00:57.700 --> 01:03.910
Even if you unplug it from your computer connected to another computer then this network device will

01:03.970 --> 01:07.420
always have the same address.

01:07.550 --> 01:15.260
So you might already know that the IP address is used in the Internet to identify computers and communicate

01:15.260 --> 01:17.750
between devices on the Internet.

01:17.870 --> 01:25.470
The market price is used within the network to identify devices and transfer data between devices.

01:26.290 --> 01:33.760
So each piece of data or packet that is sent within the network contains a source and a destination

01:33.760 --> 01:34.700
mark.

01:34.840 --> 01:39.490
Therefore this packet would flow from the source to the destination.

01:39.490 --> 01:48.290
Mark so because this is a physical unique address to each interface to each network device and because

01:48.320 --> 01:55.610
it is used to identify devices then changing it will make you anonymous on the network.

01:55.610 --> 02:02.270
Not only that but the MAC address is often used by filters to prevent or allow devices to connect to

02:02.270 --> 02:05.950
networks and do specific tasks on the network.

02:05.960 --> 02:11.750
So being able to change your MAC address to another device has MAC address will allow you to impersonate

02:11.750 --> 02:16.800
this device and allow you to do things that you might not be able to do.

02:16.940 --> 02:23.210
So you'd be able to bypass filters or connect to networks that on the specific devices with specific

02:23.210 --> 02:25.160
MAC addresses can connect to.

02:25.250 --> 02:32.140
And you'll also be able to hide your identity now change the MAC address is very very simple.

02:32.150 --> 02:34.630
Let me show you how to do that manually.

02:34.850 --> 02:38.840
And then we'll see how we can write a program to do that.

02:38.840 --> 02:46.970
So first of all we can use the ifconfig command to list all the interfaces on the current computer.

02:46.970 --> 02:50.890
When I say interface I mean a network card.

02:50.930 --> 02:54.090
So right here we have 88 0.

02:54.230 --> 02:56.580
This is actually a virtual interface.

02:56.600 --> 02:57.660
It's not real.

02:57.830 --> 03:04.700
It is created by virtual box because we set this computer to use on our network.

03:04.700 --> 03:10.700
So remember when I said that this computer thinks it is connected to a wired network and you can see

03:10.700 --> 03:18.050
it says wired connected and all of this is done through a virtual network and a virtual interface in

03:18.050 --> 03:21.390
here connected to that network.

03:21.440 --> 03:25.770
You can also see the L-O which is a virtual interface created by Linux.

03:25.940 --> 03:35.000
And I also have land zero which is an external us b wireless adapter so you might not have lines your.

03:35.140 --> 03:41.030
It's ok you don't really need it unless you want to run some of the attacks that we will do later on

03:41.270 --> 03:43.190
against a wireless network.

03:43.610 --> 03:44.960
So don't worry about it now.

03:44.960 --> 03:46.600
We'll talk more about it later.

03:46.820 --> 03:49.070
But it is not mandatory anyway.

03:50.170 --> 03:58.270
Now other than the interfaces the ifconfig command also lists information about each one of these interfaces

03:59.600 --> 04:03.530
so you can see if this interface is connected to a network.

04:03.530 --> 04:10.340
You'll see it has an IP you can see this one does not have an IP because it is not connected.

04:10.340 --> 04:18.170
You can also see the Nat mosque and the broadcast for this network and you can also see the MAC address

04:18.380 --> 04:20.090
of this interface.

04:20.090 --> 04:25.420
So right now the MAC address for E.T. 0 is the highlighted part right here.

04:26.540 --> 04:28.370
Same for 88 0.

04:28.400 --> 04:33.890
We have the MAC address in here now to change this MAC address.

04:33.950 --> 04:42.350
We're going to do ifconfig followed by the name of the interface that we want to change its MAC address.

04:42.350 --> 04:48.380
So if you want to change the MAC address of Etihad 0 you do it with zero if you want to change the MAC

04:48.380 --> 04:49.770
address or plan zero.

04:49.820 --> 04:52.980
You would do line zero.

04:53.090 --> 04:59.780
Now in this example I want to do it for 88 0 because everybody will have it Seijiro only people who

04:59.780 --> 05:02.330
have a wireless adapter will see than zero.

05:02.390 --> 05:10.900
So I'm going to do it for 88 0 so that everybody can follow this then I'm going to type down to disable

05:11.020 --> 05:12.560
this interface.

05:12.610 --> 05:13.990
So this is the first step.

05:14.080 --> 05:18.790
We're going to disable our interface I'm going to hit enter.

05:18.890 --> 05:21.660
And that's done if you don't see any errors.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.700
That means the command got executed properly.

05:25.690 --> 05:32.560
Now that the interface is disabled we can modify its options and the option that we want to modify is

05:32.560 --> 05:41.510
the Ethar which is the MAC address so I'm going to say ifconfig again put the name of the interface

05:41.510 --> 05:46.590
that you want to modify it's option which is 88 zero.

05:46.740 --> 05:50.720
We're going to say hey step you either.

05:50.870 --> 05:55.040
And we're going to specify the new MAC address that we want to use.

05:55.400 --> 05:58.540
So you can use any mac address that you want.

05:58.540 --> 06:10.490
And for example I'm just going to use 0 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 so make sure it has 12 characters.

06:10.490 --> 06:14.410
Make sure you split it using the colon and that's it.

06:15.740 --> 06:22.830
So I'm going to hit enter and again we don't see any errors so that means the command got executed properly

06:23.700 --> 06:31.270
and now all we have to do is enable the interface because we disable that using this command.

06:31.350 --> 06:38.700
So to enable the interface we're going to do if config interface name which is 88 0 and I'm going to

06:38.700 --> 06:41.030
say up to enable it.

06:41.250 --> 06:49.070
So we do it down to disable the interface and up to enable it so I'm going to hit enter and again we

06:49.070 --> 06:50.270
don't see any errors of that.

06:50.300 --> 06:53.340
So that means the command got executed properly.

06:53.540 --> 07:00.500
And the last thing that I'm going to do now is do if can fit again to see if the MAC address did actually

07:00.500 --> 07:02.090
get changed.

07:02.150 --> 07:09.290
So I'm going to hit enter and as you can see now if we look at the other part of it is 0.

07:09.440 --> 07:16.740
You can see that this has been changed to 0 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5.

07:16.820 --> 07:19.920
So as you can see it is very easy to do that.

07:19.970 --> 07:24.890
And like I said this would be useful in so many scenarios.

07:24.920 --> 07:30.320
Now the main point why I'm showing you how to change it manually is because I want you to understand

07:30.500 --> 07:32.090
what a MAC address is.

07:32.090 --> 07:33.240
Have to change it.

07:33.380 --> 07:39.590
And then in the section we're going to write a program that will automatically change the MAC address

07:39.770 --> 07:40.350
for us.
